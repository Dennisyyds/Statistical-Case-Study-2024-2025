# README

## Project Overview

This project consists of 13 R scripts designed for stylometric analysis and classification of ChatGPT-generated essays versus human-authored essays. Used to extract key stylistic features for analysis. Each script serves a different purpose, contributed by Rongzhi Chen, Shizhao Xiong and Jingqi He, from Univeristy of Edinburgh, including one files provided by a lecturer of this course, Gordon J. Ross.

### Files Description

1.**Determine Function Words.R**
Identifies function words with significant differences in frequency between ChatGPT and human-authored texts. Then perform cross-validation using these three function words.

2.**Different k for KNN.R**
Tests various values of k for the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to determine the optimal parameter for improving classification accuracy.

3.**Except topic.R**
Conducts analysis using training data that excludes essays from the same topic as the test data to assess generalization capabilities.

4.**Except_only_topic.R**
Similar to Except topic.R, but focuses exclusively on excluding essays from a specific topic for targeted testing.

5.**Form_of_data.R**
Compare the performance from 10-fold cross-validations using combined dataset and Separate dataset

6.**OnlyTopic.R**
Performs classification using only essays from the same topic as the test data to evaluate the impact of topic-specific training data.

7.r**educewords.R**
Provided by the lecturer, used to trim the essays down to a specified word count.

8.**Set Up.R**
Initializes the environment and loads necessary packages, datasets, and configurations required for running the analyses.

9.**stylometryfunctions.R**
Contains all the important stylometric functions used throughout the project for feature extraction and statistical analysis.

10.**Test parameter of SVM.R**
Evaluates the performance of the SVM classifier with different parameter configurations to identify the best settings.

11.**traindata_size.R**
Examines the impact of varying training data sizes on classifier performance, including accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 scores.

12.**Visualization.R**
Generates MDS plot to illustrate classification performance, function word distributions, and other analytical results.

13.**WordLength.R**
Analyzes how essay length impacts classifier performance and evaluates classifiersâ€™ ability to handle varying text lengths.

### Usage Instructions

Start by running Set Up.R to load required packages and initialize the environment.
Depending on your objective, run the relevant scripts:
For visualization, use Visualization.R
For study 1, use form_of_data.R
For study 2, use Different k for KNN.R or Test parameter of SVM.R
For study 4, use Determine Function Words.R
For study 5, use traindata_size.R
For study 6, use Except topic.R, Except_only_topic.R and OnlyTopic.R


Notes

1. Install necessary R packages before running the scripts. Commonly required libraries might include:
   - `ggplot2`
   - `lattice`
   - `tidyverse`
   - `caret`
   - `writexl`

2. The scripts generate output files such as graphs or processed data, which should be saved in the same working directory. These outputs will be used in generating the final report.
